## üìù Notes

This plugin does not check for the presence of [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or the Dracula stylesheet before adding this to WordPress. It's intended to be an all-in-one solution for the Block Editor.

## üìã Future Features
- [ ] Check to see if highlight.js is already loaded
- [ ] Add editor stylesheet
- [ ] Improve performance by using PHP to add classes to the document rather than JavaScript
- [ ] Remove the need for `!important` in stylesheets.
